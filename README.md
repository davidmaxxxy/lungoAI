# LungoAI - AI-Powered Investment Insights for Retail Investors

## Overview

Lungo is an AI-driven investment app designed to help retail investors analyze macroeconomic trends and make informed decisions by identifying potential winners and losers across various asset classes. Users can define trends, generate stock ideas, analyze them based on key financial metrics, and build a portfolio for long-term success.

### Problem

The surge in retail investors over recent years, driven by technological advancements, the COVID-19 pandemic, and regulatory changes, has reshaped the financial markets. As of 2024, retail investors make up approximately 19.5% of the U.S. equity trading volume and control 52% of global assets under management (AUM), a figure projected to reach 61% by 2030. These investors are leveraging tools like commission-free trading apps and fractional share investing to gain market access, influencing corporate governance and market trends.

However, despite their growing presence, 70-90% of retail traders lose money, especially in speculative trading strategies like day trading and derivatives. Studies show that only the top 5% of retail traders account for 75% of all profits, while the majority struggle due to poor decision-making, lack of experience, and insufficient access to advanced tools and data. This gap highlights the need for a solution that provides retail investors with the same level of insights and resources as the top performers, empowering them to adopt more successful long-term strategies.

### User Profile

Target Audience:
Lungo is designed for retail investors who are looking to improve their investment decision-making through a better understanding of macroeconomic trends and advanced analysis tools. This includes:

1. Novice Investors: Individuals who are new to investing and are looking for guidance on how to understand market trends and build a long-term portfolio.
2. Experienced Retail Investors: Those who have traded before but are seeking advanced tools and insights to better navigate market complexities.
3. Long-term Investors: Users who prefer to build sustainable portfolios over time, rather than engaging in short-term speculative trading.

### Features

1. Macro Trend Definition & Asset Impact Analysis
   Users input macroeconomic trends (e.g., inflation, interest rate changes, technological advancements), and the app generates a detailed analysis of how these trends affect different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies.

2. Winners & Losers Generation
   Based on the impact analysis, the app identifies potential winning and losing assets across sectors, providing a list of stocks and other securities that are likely to benefit or suffer from each macro trend.

3. Financial Metric Evaluation
   Users can evaluate each asset using detailed financial metrics like price performance, valuation ratios (P/E, EV/EBITDA), and financial health indicators. The app will provide a comprehensive comparison to help users make informed decisions about adding assets to their portfolios.

4. Portfolio Management
   Users can create custom portfolios based on macro trends and assign weightings to each stock. The app will track performance and provide ongoing analysis of the portfolio based on changing market conditions.
